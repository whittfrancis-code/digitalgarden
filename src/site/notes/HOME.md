This is my personal [[Backlog/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] - a place where I yap about the things I like/dislike, and try to keep it organized.

# Brother, why did you make this when Twitter/Tumblr is a thing?
&nbsp;

The older I have gotten, the more I've realized that I hate the modern Internet.  I grew up in the era of forums and blogs, these tiny little spaces carved out on the Internet for incredibly niche interests (RIP SuFu/onRPG).  Social Media is great, and I doom scroll like everyone else, but having that tiny space carved out for myself is something I miss sorely.  It's also a great way to attempt to stay sharp with my technical skills while battling <s> unemployment (shoutouts to future Nikko if you land a job </s> the monstrosity that is banking.  

&nbsp;

# So what the fuck is there to do here? 
&nbsp;

Nothing really.  On the left side nav there should be different folders for "Notes" - these are basically just little scribblings of shit I am into, currently up to, etc etc.  Some of it may be things I did recently that I think was interesting, some of it may literally just be links to my WoW logs.  This is basically just a Xanga, but in 2025.  


&nbsp;

# Hey, I think this is kinda neat.  How do I make one? 
&nbsp;

Refer to the following link [[HOW TO MAKE A DIGITAL GARDEN\|HOW TO MAKE A DIGITAL GARDEN]] - this should take you to my notes on how to make one.  This is how I made this, so obviously your mileage may vary, so make sure to use Google, refer to the official Obsidian [[Backlog/Discord\|Discord]], ask Claude etc etc.

# About me
&nbsp;

I'm a 34 year old Senior BA with a focus on QA Testing & Project Management.  In my spare time, I am massive nerd who spends way too much time I don't have playing MMOs, Fighting Games, and CRPG/JRPG's.  I'm huge into japanese fashion, and have a concerning growing collection of records (mostly jazz/90's hip-hop/house/weird field recordings).  I like to rock climb when I am not battling self loathing, and have way too much general knowledge on the random hyper fixations I have that rotate monthly.  My current hyper fixation is on Umamusume and its probably going to one shot a bunch of people and get them into horse racing.  As of right now, I am currently <s> unemployed and have been fighting the true end game boss that is LinkedIn </s> fighting the true end game boss that is financial services.  I have a wife and a dog.  I love the both of them dearly.
